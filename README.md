# Diablo 2 Unique Monster Name Generator
A generator to create names of unique monsters from Diablo 2.

I was unsatisfied with the unique monster name generators I found online, so I decided to quickly write one myself!

## How it works
In Diablo 2, unique monsters are stronger monsters distingushed by their golden names. These names are randomly generated with three parts: a prefix, a suffix, and sometimes an appelation at the end. Each of these parts are chosen from their own pre-defined lists. While I'm not sure how exactly Diablo 2 chooses whether or not to add an appelation, I chose to randomly add it to the monster name 50% of the time in my script.

The list of unique monster name prefixes, suffixes, and appelations in Diablo 2 were found on https://diablo-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Unique_Monsters_(Diablo_II). 

## Using the script
In order to use this script, first make sure you have some version of Python 3 installed. Then, run the script provided here in Python.

You can choose the number of unique monsters' names you want in two ways:
1) Pass it in as a parameter when running the script.
2) If a number isn't provided as a parameter, the script will prompt you for the number of unique monster names you want.

## Sample Unique Monster Names
### With Appelations
- Haze Web the Flayer
- Storm Wing the Slayer
- Snot Pus the Jagged

### Without Appelations
- Seethe Maw
- Dread Grin
- Bone Killer
